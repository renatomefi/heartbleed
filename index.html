        <p>A Vulnerabilidade Heartbleed é um bug severo na popular biblioteca de criptografia chamada OpenSSL. A falha
            permite roubo de informação protegida pelas criptografias nos protocolos SSL/TLS, esta que é de comum uso
            para segurança na internet. Os protocolos SSL/TLS fornecem comunicação segura e privacidade em conexões de
            internet, muito utilizados em aplicações web, email, mensageiros instantâneos (IM) e redes de comunicação
            privadas (VPNs).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the
            vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the
            service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual
            content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and
            users and to impersonate services and users.</p>

        <h3>What leaks in practice?</h3>

        <p>We have tested some of our own services from attacker's perspective. We attacked ourselves from outside,
            without leaving a trace. Without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from
            ourselves the secret keys used for our X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages,
            emails and business critical documents and communication.</p>

            it has to be deployed. Operating system vendors and distribution, appliance vendors, independent
            software vendors have to adopt the fix and notify their users. Service providers and users have to
            install the fix as it becomes available for the operating systems, networked appliances and software

<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<h4>What is the CVE-2014-0160?</h4>

<p>CVE-2014-0160 is the official reference to this bug. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is the
    Standard for Information Security Vulnerability Names maintained by <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/">MITRE</a>.
    Due to co-incident discovery a duplicate CVE, CVE-2014-0346, which was assigned to us, should not be
    used, since others independently went public with the CVE-2014-0160 identifier.</p>

<h4>Why it is called the Heartbleed Bug?</h4>

<p>Bug is in the OpenSSL's implementation of the TLS/DTLS (transport layer security protocols) heartbeat
    extension (RFC6520). When it is exploited it leads to the leak of memory contents from the server to the
    client and from the client to the server.</p>

<h4>What makes the Heartbleed Bug unique?</h4>

<p>Bugs in single software or library come and go and are fixed by new versions. However this bug has left
    large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the Internet. Considering the long exposure,
    ease of exploitation and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously.</p>

<h4>Is this a design flaw in SSL/TLS protocol specification?</h4>

<p>No. This is implementation problem, i.e. programming mistake in popular OpenSSL library that provides
    cryptographic services such as SSL/TLS to the applications and services.</p>

<h4>What is being leaked?</h4>

<p>Encryption is used to protect secrets that may harm your privacy or security if they leak. In order to
    coordinate recovery from this bug we have classified the compromised secrets to four categories: 1)
    primary key material, 2) secondary key material and 3) protected content and 4) collateral.</p>

<h4>What is leaked primary key material and how to recover?</h4>

<p>These are the crown jewels, the encryption keys themselves. Leaked secret keys allows the attacker to
    decrypt any past and future traffic to the protected services and to impersonate the service at will.
    Any protection given by the encryption and the signatures in the X.509 certificates can be bypassed.
    Recovery from this leak requires patching the vulnerability, revocation of the compromised keys and
    reissuing and redistributing new keys. Even doing all this will still leave any traffic intercepted by
    the attacker in the past still vulnerable to decryption. All this has to be done by the owners of the
    services.</p>

<h4>What is leaked secondary key material and how to recover?</h4>

<p>These are for example the user credentials (user names and passwords) used in the vulnerable services.
    Recovery from this leaks requires owners of the service first to restore trust to the service according
    to steps described above. After this users can start changing their passwords and possible encryption
    keys according to the instructions from the owners of the services that have been compromised. All
    session keys and session cookies should be invalided and considered compromised.</p>

<h4>What is leaked protected content and how to recover?</h4>

<p>This is the actual content handled by the vulnerable services. It may be personal or financial details,
    private communication such as emails or instant messages, documents or anything seen worth protecting by
    encryption. Only owners of the services will be able to estimate the likelihood what has been leaked and
    they should notify their users accordingly. Most important thing is to restore trust to the primary and
    secondary key material as described above. Only this enables safe use of the compromised services in the
    future.</p>

<h4>What is leaked collateral and how to recover?</h4>

<p>Leaked collateral are other details that have been exposed to the attacker in the leaked memory content.
    These may contain technical details such as memory addresses and security measures such as canaries used
    to protect against overflow attacks. These have only contemporary value and will lose their value to the
    attacker when OpenSSL has been upgraded to a fixed version.</p>

<h4>Recovery sounds laborious, is there a short cut?</h4>

<p>After seeing what we saw by "attacking" ourselves, with ease, we decided to take this very seriously. We
    have gone laboriously through patching our own critical services and are in progress of dealing with
    possible compromise of our primary and secondary key material. All this just in case we were not first
    ones to discover this and this could have been exploited in the wild already.</p>

<h4>How revocation and reissuing of certificates works in practice?</h4>

<p>If you are a service provider you have signed your certificates with a Certificate Authority (CA). You
    need to check your CA how compromised keys can be revoked and new certificate reissued for the new keys.
    Some CAs do this for free, some may take a fee.</p>

<h4>Am I affected by the bug?</h4>

<p>You are likely to be affected either directly or indirectly. OpenSSL is the most popular open source
    cryptographic library and TLS (transport layer security) implementation used to encrypt traffic on the
    Internet. Your popular social site, your company's site, commerce site, hobby site, site you install
    software from or even sites run by your government might be using vulnerable OpenSSL. Many of online
    services use TLS to both to identify themselves to you and to protect your privacy and transactions. You
    might have networked appliances with logins secured by this buggy implementation of the TLS. Furthermore
    you might have client side software on your computer that could expose the data from your computer if
    you connect to compromised services.</p>

<h4>How widespread is this?</h4>

<p>Most notable software using OpenSSL are the open source web servers like Apache and nginx. The combined
    market share of just those two out of the active sites on the Internet was over 66% according to <a
            href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/04/02/april-2014-web-server-survey.html">Netcraft's
        April 2014 Web Server Survey</a>. Furthermore OpenSSL is used to protect for example email servers
    (SMTP, POP and IMAP protocols), chat servers (XMPP protocol), virtual private networks (SSL VPNs),
    network appliances and wide variety of client side software. Fortunately many large consumer sites are
    saved by their conservative choice of SSL/TLS termination equipment and software. Ironically smaller and
    more progressive services or those who have upgraded to latest and best encryption will be affected
    most. Furthermore OpenSSL is very popular in client software and somewhat popular in networked
    appliances which have most inertia in getting updates.</p>

<h4>What versions of the OpenSSL are affected?</h4>

<p>Status of different versions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) are vulnerable</li>
    <li>OpenSSL 1.0.1g is NOT vulnerable</li>
    <li>OpenSSL 1.0.0 branch is NOT vulnerable</li>
    <li>OpenSSL 0.9.8 branch is NOT vulnerable</li>
</ul>

<p>Bug was introduced to OpenSSL in December 2011 and has been out in the wild since OpenSSL release 1.0.1
    on 14th of March 2012. OpenSSL 1.0.1g released on 7th of April 2014 fixes the bug.</p>

<h4>How common are the vulnerable OpenSSL versions?</h4>

<p>The vulnerable versions have been out there for over two years now and they have been rapidly adopted by
    modern operating systems. A major contributing factor has been that TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 came
    available with the first vulnerable OpenSSL version (1.0.1) and security community has been pushing the
    TLS 1.2 due to earlier attacks against TLS (such as the <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack">BEAST</a>).</p>

<h4>How about operating systems?</h4>

<p>Some operating system distributions that have shipped with potentially vulnerable OpenSSL version:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Debian Wheezy (stable), OpenSSL 1.0.1e-2+deb7u4</li>
    <li>Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS, OpenSSL 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.11</li>
    <li>CentOS 6.5, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-15</li>
    <li>Fedora 18, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-4</li>
    <li>OpenBSD 5.3 (OpenSSL 1.0.1c 10 May 2012) and 5.4 (OpenSSL 1.0.1c 10 May 2012)</li>
    <li>FreeBSD 10.0 - OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013</li>
    <li>NetBSD 5.0.2 (OpenSSL 1.0.1e)</li>
    <li>OpenSUSE 12.2 (OpenSSL 1.0.1c)</li>
</ul>

<p>Operating system distribution with versions that are not vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Debian Squeeze (oldstable), OpenSSL 0.9.8o-4squeeze14</li>
    <li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</li>
    <li>FreeBSD 8.4 - OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013</li>
    <li>FreeBSD 9.2 - OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013</li>
    <li>FreeBSD Ports - OpenSSL 1.0.1g (At 7 Apr 21:46:40 2014 UTC)</li>
</ul>

<h4>How can OpenSSL be fixed?</h4>

<p>Even though the actual code fix may appear trivial, OpenSSL team is the expert in fixing it properly so
    latest fixed version 1.0.1g or newer should be used. If this is not possible software developers can
    recompile OpenSSL with the handshake removed from the code by compile time option
    <code>-DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS</code>.
</p>

<h4>Should heartbeat be removed to aid in detection of vulnerable services?</h4>

<p>Recovery from this bug could benefit if the new version of the OpenSSL would both fix the bug and disable
    heartbeat temporarily until some future version. It appears that majority if not almost all TLS
    implementations that respond to the heartbeat request today are vulnerable versions of OpenSSL. If only
    vulnerable versions of OpenSSL would continue to respond to the heartbeat for next few months then large
    scale coordinated response to reach owners of vulnerable services would become more feasible.</p>

<h4>Can I detect if someone has exploited this against me?</h4>

<p>Exploitation of this bug leaves no traces of anything abnormal happening to the logs.</p>

<h4>Can IDS/IPS detect or block this attack?</h4>

<p>Although the content of the heartbeat request is encrypted it has its own record type in the protocol.
    This should allow intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to be trained to detect use of
    the heartbeat request. Due to encryption differentiating between legitimate use and attack can not be
    based on the content of the request, but the attack may be detected by comparing the size of the request
    against the size of the reply. This seems to imply that IDS/IPS can be programmed to detect the attack
    but not to block it unless heartbeat requests are blocked altogether.</p>

<h4>Has this been abused in the wild?</h4>

<p>We don't know. Security community should deploy TLS/DTLS honeypots that entrap attackers and to alert
    about exploitation attempts.</p>

<h4>Can attacker access only 64k of the memory?</h4>

<p>There is no total of 64 kilobytes limitation to the attack, that limit applies only to a single
    heartbeat. Attacker can either keep reconnecting or during an active TLS connection keep requesting
    arbitrary number of 64 kilobyte chunks of memory content until enough secrets are revealed.</p>

<h4>Is this a MITM bug like Apple's goto fail bug was?</h4>

<p>No this doesn't require a man in the middle attack (MITM). Attacker can directly contact the vulnerable
    service or attack any user connecting to a malicious service. However in addition to direct threat the
    theft of the key material allows man in the middle attackers to impersonate compromised services.</p>

<h4>Does TLS client certificate authentication mitigate this?</h4>

<p>No, heartbeat request can be sent and is replied to during the handshake phase of the protocol. This
    occurs prior to client certificate authentication.</p>

<h4>Does OpenSSL's FIPS mode mitigate this?</h4>

<p>No, OpenSSL Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) mode has no effect on the vulnerable heartbeat
    functionality.</p>

<h4>Does Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) mitigate this?</h4>

<p>Use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), which is unfortunately rare but powerful, should protect past
    communications from retrospective decryption. Please see <a
            href="https://twitter.com/ivanristic/status/453280081897467905">https://twitter.com/ivanristic/status/453280081897467905</a>
    how leaked tickets may affect this.</p>

<h4>Can heartbeat extension be disabled during the TLS handshake?</h4>

<p>No, vulnerable heartbeat extension code is activated regardless of the results of the handshake phase
    negotiations. Only way to protect yourself is to upgrade to fixed version of OpenSSL or to recompile
    OpenSSL with the handshake removed from the code.</p>

<h4>Who found the Heartbleed Bug?</h4>

<p>This bug was independently discovered by a team of security engineers (Riku, Antti and Matti) at <a
        href="http://www.codenomicon.com/">Codenomicon</a> and Neel Mehta of Google Security, who first
    reported it to the OpenSSL team. Codenomicon team found heartbleed bug while improving the SafeGuard
    feature in Codenomicon's Defensics security testing tools and reported this bug to the NCSC-FI for
    vulnerability coordination and reporting to OpenSSL team.</p>

<h4>What is the Defensics SafeGuard?</h4>

<p>The SafeGuard feature of the Codenomicon's Defensics security testtools automatically tests the target
    system for weaknesses that compromise the integrity, privacy or safety. The SafeGuard is systematic
    solution to expose failed cryptographic certificate checks, privacy leaks or authentication bypass
    weaknesses that have exposed the Internet users to man in the middle attacks and eavesdropping. In
    addition to the Heartbleed bug the new Defensics TLS Safeguard feature can detect for instance the
    exploitable security flaw in widely used GnuTLS open source software implementing SSL/TLS functionality
    and the <a href="http://gotofail.com/">"goto fail;"</a> bug in Apple's TLS/SSL implementation that was
    patched in February 2014.</p>

<h4>Who coordinates response to this vulnerability?</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.cert.fi/en/index.html">NCSC-FI</a> took up the task of reaching out to the authors
    of OpenSSL, software, operating system and appliance vendors, which were potentially affected. However,
    this vulnerability was found and details released independently by others before this work was
    completed. Vendors should be notifying their users and service providers. Internet service providers
    should be notifying their end users where and when potential action is required.</p>

<h4>Is there a bright side to all this?</h4>

<p>For those service providers who are affected this is a good opportunity to upgrade security strength of
    the secret keys used. A lot of software gets updates which otherwise would have not been urgent.
    Although this is painful for the security community, we can rest assured that infrastructure of the
    cyber criminals and their secrets have been exposed as well.</p>

<h4>Where to find more information?</h4>

<p>This Q&amp;A was published as a follow-up to the OpenSSL advisory, since this vulnerability became public
    on 7th of April 2014. The OpenSSL project has made a statement at <a
            href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt">https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt</a>.
    NCSC-FI published an advisory at <a href="https://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2014/vulnerability788210.html">https://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2014/vulnerability788210.html</a>.
    Individual vendors of operating system distributions, affected owners of Internet services, software
    packages and appliance vendors may issue their own advisories.</p>
